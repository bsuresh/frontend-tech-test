# Frontend Tech Test
The goal of this test is to take some JSON data, manipulate it and present it in a table format.
Please use any tools/libraries which you feel necessary.  

The below endpoint will return a JSON response for the top 100 Crypto Currencies:  https://api.coincap.io/v2/assets

This data is all linked to the USD price.
Using this currency service, you will be able to convert this to other currencies: https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD

Please use the data from both the above APIs to build out a table of the top 25 ranked Crypto Currencies. Include the ID, Rank, Symbol, Link to their respective websites and their USD price converted to GBP, EUR and AED. Please make the table sortable based on the table headings.
The design of the table will not be judged – it should look professional but please don’t spend too long making it look pretty.

Once completed please share a link to the code on a public repo (github etc).
